# puppet_lab1

This is sample project to spin up basic lab environment for puppet server and one agent node respectively.

The main objective behind this, is automating the vm creation and required software installation. As lab environment creation is rather manual and repeatative task.

It creates 2 virtual machines ( 2 centos instances) on platform 9 using vagrant.
